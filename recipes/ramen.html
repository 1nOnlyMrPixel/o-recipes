    <h2>Directions</h2>
    
    <ol>    
        
        <!-- STEP 1 -->
        <li> 
            <p>
                Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add onion and sauté until starting to soften, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and ginger; cook about 30 seconds more. Add rice vinegar, soy sauce, oyster sauce, mirin, fish sauce, and Sriracha sauce; stir to combine. Add chicken broth and water and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for about 5 minutes. Stir in bok choy and chicken; simmer gently until bok choy is just tender, about 2 minutes. Cover and keep warm. 
            </p>
        </li>

        <!-- STEP 2 -->
        <li>   
                <p>
                    Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Add ramen noodles and return to a boil. Cook, uncovered and stirring occasionally, until noodles are tender yet firm to the bite, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain noodles and drizzle with remaining 1 tablespoon oil to prevent sticking. 
                </p>
        </li>

        <!-- STEP 3 -->
        <li>
            <p>While the ramen is cooking, fill a pot with enough water to cover the eggs and bring to a boil. Gently lower eggs into the boiling water and cook until yolks are barely set, about 7 minutes. </p>
        </li>
        
        <!-- STEP 4 -->
        <li>
            <p>
                Fill a large bowl with ice water. Transfer eggs to the ice bath to stop the cooking process; let sit about 3 minutes. Drain eggs, carefully peel away the shells, and slice in half. 
            </p>
        </li>
        
        <!-- STEP 5 -->
        <li>
            <p>
                Divide ramen between four bowls. Add broth, then top with jalapeño, green onions, cilantro, and soft boiled egg halves. Serve immediately. 
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
